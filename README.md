# Augmented-Reality-Projects

➔ Using Augmented Reality to illustrate several usability ideas in diverse areas of life is the aim of this project.

➔ The libraries AR.js and THREE.js are used.

➔ Gained an understanding of several components required during augmented reality web application development, such as 3D space, marker based vs. marker-less apps, mixed reality, virtual reality, webxr, Aframe, lighting, etc.

➔ Hosted the website using netlify after learning its working

HOW TO TRY THE PROJECT:
- All the projects are marker based, which means you’ll either need a printout of a marker or you’ll need two devices. 

MARKER: Any object that can be placed in a scene to provide a fixed point of reference of position and/or scale. It allows the device that is generating the AR content to calculate the position and orientation of its camera. 

This is a Hiro marker, which is most commonly used:

Open the marker image on a second device and keep it in front of the main device’s camera to see how the project works.
