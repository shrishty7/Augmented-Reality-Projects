# Augmented-Reality-Projects
 Some mini AR projects made with three.js and ar.js libraries.

HOW TO TRY THE PROJECT:
- All the projects are marker based, which means you’ll either need a printout of a marker or you’ll need two devices. 

MARKER: Any object that can be placed in a scene to provide a fixed point of reference of position and/or scale. It allows the device that is generating the AR content to calculate the position and orientation of its camera. 

This is a Hiro marker, which is most commonly used:

Open the marker image on a second device and keep it in front of the main device’s camera to see how the project works.
